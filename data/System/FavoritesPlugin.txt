---+ !FavoritesPlugin

%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

This plugin implements a simple bookmarking system for topics and attachments.
It stores bookmarks as META fields in the user's personal topic. The following
things are implemented:

   * =FAVORITEBUTTON= Macro to render a button to favorite/unfavorite a
     topic/attachment, and corresponding REST handlers
   * Rename handlers that update bookmarks when a topic or attachment is
     renamed

---++ =FAVORITEBUTTON= macro

Renders a button or link that toggles "favoriteness" of a topic or attachment.

|  *Attribute*  |  *Meaning*  |
| =web= | Web the topic/attachment is in; defaults to current web. |
| =topic= | The topic. |
| =file= | The attachment. If not set, the button is for the topic itself. |
| <code>active_<em>xyz</em></code> | Defines the replacement for the \
    placeholder <code>$<em>xyz</em></code> used when the topic/attachment\
    is currently favorited. You may use the normal placeholders pre-defined\
    by the plugin within these definitions. |
| <code>inactive_<em>xyz</em></code> | Same, but for topics/attachments\
    currently _not_ favorited. |
| =format= | What to render. The following placeholders are expanded:<ul>\
    <li> *$web*, *$topic*, *$file*: you can probably guess these.</li>\
    <li> *$name*: internal name for the bookmark that uniquely identifies\
      it.</li>\
    <li> *$formstart*, *$formend*: beginning and end of a form definition\
      that, if inserted around something that submits it, will take care of\
      toggling the "favoriteness" of the topic/attachment in question.</li>\
    <li> *$url*: a URL that can be used as a link target to toggle the\
      "favoriteness" of the topic/attachment in question.</li>\
    </ul> |
| =redirectto= | An alternative topic to redirect to after the button's\
    action has completed; defaults to the topic the bookmark refers to. |

Example (for use within the attachtables template):

<verbatim class="tml">
%FAVORITEBUTTON{
  file="%A_FILE%"
  active_suffix="active"
  inactive_suffix="inactive"
  active_label="%MAKETEXT{"Mark as favorite"}%"
  inactive_label="%MAKETEXT{"Unmark as favorite"}%"
  format="$formstart<button type=\"submit\">
    <img src=\"%PUBURLPATH%/Myiconset/fav_$suffix\" alt=\"$label\">
  </button>$formend"
}%
</verbatim>
